    <h2>
        About Me
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Personal Background
    </h3>
        <p>
            I was born and raised in a small town in Kansas called Ottawa. With just over 13,000 people, Ottawa has a small-town
            atmosphere where everybody knows everybody. I've grown to love that tight-knit atmosphere. It's the primary reason I want to be
            Software Engineer. I want to be able to work from home in such a way that I can be with my family in the times that matter the 
            most. On top of that, exorcising my creativity in the form of programming has been a wonderful avenue of release. 
            I'm beyond excited to learn more in-depth programming so that I can design more and more interesting, and advanced things. 
        </p>
    <h3>
        Interests
    </h3>
        <p>
        I have a unique mind with a mix of technical prowess and emotional aptitude. From theoretical physics, computer hardware,
        and software engineering, to ancient Roman history, and literature; I enjoy learning about a variety of topics. I also have a 
        deep sense of personal emotion. I think it's imperative that humans understand each other beyond mere technical, or literal means.
        Tapping into another's emotion and being with them in their struggles, or rejoicing with them on their day is perhaps the greatest
        gift any of us have to offer.
