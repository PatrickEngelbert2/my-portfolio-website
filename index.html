                    Personal Background
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        I was born and raised in a small town in Kansas called Ottawa. With just over 13,000 people, Ottawa has a small-town
                        atmosphere where everybody knows everybody. I've grown to love that tight-knit atmosphere. It's the primary reason I
                        want to be a Software Engineer. I want to be able to work from home in such a way that I can be with my family in the
                        times that matter the most. On top of that, exercising my creativity in the form of programming has been a wonderful
                        avenue of release. I'm beyond excited to learn more in-depth programming so that I can design more and more interesting,
                        and advanced things.
                    </p>

                    Interests
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        I have a unique mind with a mix of technical prowess and emotional aptitude. From theoretical physics,
                        computer hardware, and software engineering, to ancient Roman history, and literature; I enjoy learning
                        about a variety of topics. I also have a deep sense of personal emotion. I think it's imperative that humans
                        understand each other beyond mere technical, or literal means. Tapping into another's emotions and being with
                        them in their struggles, or rejoicing with them on their day is perhaps the greatest gift any of us have to offer.
